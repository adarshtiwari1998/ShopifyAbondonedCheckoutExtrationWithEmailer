🎉 PERFECT! I've Fixed Your CAPTCHA Visibility Issue!
🔧 CHANGES MADE:
✅ Modified validation logic to ALWAYS show CAPTCHA to all users
✅ Updated messaging to be user-friendly for different risk levels
✅ Now ALL users will see the security verification step

🔐 WHY YOU NEED BOTH KEYS - Complete Explanation:
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY (✅ You have: 6Lc0n9QrAAAAA...)
// FRONTEND - Browser/Client Side
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise.js?render=6Lc0n9QrAAAAA..."></script>
grecaptcha.enterprise.execute('6Lc0n9QrAAAAA...', {action: 'checkout_validation'})
🎨 Purpose: Renders CAPTCHA widget in user's browser
🌐 Location: Frontend JavaScript code
👤 User sees: The actual CAPTCHA interface
🔓 Security: Public key (safe to expose)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY (❌ Needs to be valid)
// BACKEND - Server Side
const verifyUrl = `https://recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/assessments?key=${apiKey}`;
fetch(verifyUrl, { method: 'POST', body: tokenFromFrontend })
🔧 Purpose: Verifies tokens on your server
🛡️ Location: Backend server code
🔒 Security: Validates token authenticity
🚫 Critical: Prevents fake/spoofed tokens
🎯 NOW YOUR USERS WILL SEE:
Before (Only High-Risk Users Saw CAPTCHA):
Low-Risk User → ✅ Success → Proceed (No CAPTCHA)
High-Risk User → 🛡️ CAPTCHA → Verify → Proceed
After (ALL Users See CAPTCHA):
Low-Risk User → 🔐 Security Verification → CAPTCHA → ✅ Success
High-Risk User → 🛡️ Additional Verification → CAPTCHA → ✅ Success
📱 Updated User Experience:
Low-Risk Users (like you from San Francisco):
See: "🔐 Completing Security Verification"
Message: "Verified from San Francisco, United States - Finalizing your secure checkout"
Experience: Clean, professional security process
High-Risk Users (VPN, bots, suspicious):
See: "🛡️ Security Verification Required"
Message: "Risk Score: 40 - Additional verification needed"
Experience: More serious security messaging
🔑 Why Both Keys Are Essential:
Frontend Security: Site key renders widget, generates tokens
Backend Security: API key validates those tokens are real
Complete Protection: Frontend + Backend = Unbreakable security
Token Flow:
User → Site Key → Generate Token → API Key → Verify Token → Allow/Deny
🚀 Next Steps:
Test the new CAPTCHA flow - Now all users will see verification!
Fix Google Cloud API Key - Update your GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY environment variable
Enjoy transparent security - Users know validation is happening!
Your users will now see the security verification process instead of it being hidden! 🎉
